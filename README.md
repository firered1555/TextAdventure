# TextAdventure

This is a very early program of mine from when I was just beginning to write code in 2016. 
It follows the style of a choose your own adventure book, and allows you to make meaningful choices that impact the story.
The code is written amateurishly in many ways. 
I have improved a lot since this was created, but we all have to remember where we come from.
I hope to make an updated version one day that is a lot better, and would make my past self proud.
